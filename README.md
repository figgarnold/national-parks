Code Academy Biodiversity Project Overview:  
This project will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.
Data will be analysed on the conservation statuses of these species and identify any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. This will require: data cleaning, analysis, plotting and presenting a report on any findings.
